About YOURLS
============

## What is YOURLS

**YOURLS** stands for **Your Own URL Shortener**. It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (_a la_ TinyURL or bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and don't depend on third party services. It's also a great way to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.

## YOURLS Features

*   `Free` and `Open Source` software.
*   `Private` (your links only) or `Public` (everybody can create short links, fine for an intranet)
*   Sequential or custom URL keyword
*   Handy `bookmarklets` to easily shorten and share links
*   Awesome `stats`: historical click reports, referrers tracking, visitors geo-location
*   Neat `Ajaxed` interface
*   Terrific `Plugin` architecture to easily implement new features
*   Cool developer `API`
*   Full `jsonp` support
*   Friendly `installer`
*   `Sample files` to create your own public interface and more
